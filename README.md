# Skiff

A lightweight Mediator implementation for Dart projects.

This package allows you to write smaller, more robust and testable code by
turning data access logic (or anything else you can think of) into first-class
objects with sound typing.

## Installing

With Dart:

```
 $ dart pub add skiff
```

With Flutter:

```
 $ flutter pub add skiff
```
